This is a folder for a bash script that move asll .htaccess files present in a cpanel to a separate folder on a hosting plan. This would make sure that .htaccess files with deny codes can be removed with a single bash script instead of having to delete it one by one by going to all folders. Please keep in mind that this doees not remove any malware but only the .htaccess files which are present around the entire hosting plan on your account. If you have any custom htaccess files please make sure to take a backup of them to reupload them.
